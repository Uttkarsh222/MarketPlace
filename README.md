## Signup page:


-- Container: A fundamental Bootstrap component that is used to align the content within a centered width or full width based on the screen size.

-- Row: Works within the grid system to create horizontal groups of columns.

-- Columns (col-md-6 col-lg-4): Define the width of the content area for different screen sizes, utilizing Bootstrap's responsive grid layout.

-- Card: A Bootstrap component that provides a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options, used here to wrap the sign-up form.

-- Card Body: Part of the card component, it's used for padding around the content within a card.

-- Form Group: Utilized to encapsulate each label-input pair, providing proper spacing and organization for form elements.

-- Form Control: Applied to input elements to enable the default styling provided by Bootstrap for forms. It's used here for text inputs, email inputs, and password inputs.

-- Button (btn btn-primary btn-block): Styling buttons with Bootstrap classes to apply primary button styling and make the button extend the full width of its parent container.



## Login page 

-- Container: Serves as the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and is used for aligning the page's content within a centered or fixed width. It ensures that the login form is properly centered and padded on the page.

-- Row: A direct child of a container, the row serves to create horizontal groups of columns. It's used here to organize the layout of the login form, ensuring that it is centered horizontally on the page.

-- Columns (col-md-6 col-lg-4): Bootstrap's grid system is based on 12 columns, and these classes control how much width a column should take on different screen sizes. For medium (md) screens, the column takes up half the container width (6 columns), and for large (lg) screens, it takes up one-third (4 columns), making the form responsive.

-- Card: A flexible and extensible content container that includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. In this case, it's used to encapsulate the login form, providing a visually distinct area that separates it from the rest of the page.

-- Card Body: This is where the content of the card goes, such as text, links, and forms. It's used here to contain the form elements like input fields and buttons, providing a padded area for better organization and readability.

-- Form Group: A wrapper for a form input and its label, used to ensure proper spacing and alignment. Each form group in the page encapsulates a label-input pair, enhancing the form's structure and making it more user-friendly.

-- Form Control: Applied to input fields, this class gives text inputs a width of 100%, ensuring they are fully responsive and stylized according to Bootstrap's form styles. It's used for the username and password fields to maintain consistency and usability.

-- Button (btn btn-primary btn-block): The btn class applies basic button styling, btn-primary gives the button a primary theme color, making it stand out as the main call to action, and btn-block makes the button extend to the full width of its parent, emphasizing its importance and making it easier to click on smaller screens.
